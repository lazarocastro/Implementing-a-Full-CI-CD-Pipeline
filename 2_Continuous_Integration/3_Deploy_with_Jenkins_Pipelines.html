                                <p></p><p>In order to succeed with continuous delivery and continuous deployment, deployment automation is essential. In this lesson, we will be implementing automated deployments within a Jenkins pipeline. We will create pipeline stages to automatically deploy to a staging server and a production server. After completing this lesson, you will have some familiarity with how automated deployment can be implementing using Jenkins Pipelines.</p>
<br>
<p>Check out the pipeline steps reference for the Publish Over SSH plugin used in the demo: <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/publish-over-ssh/">https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/publish-over-ssh/</a></p>
<br>
<p>Here is the sample source code used in the demo. Check the example-solution branch for the complete Jenkinsfile: <a href="https://github.com/linuxacademy/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-cd">https://github.com/linuxacademy/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-cd</a></p>
<br>
<p>In order to set up automated deployment, you need to prepare the production and staging servers by:
</p><ul>
<li>Creating a deploy user with the necessary permissions to deploy</li>
<li>Configuring the train-schedule app as a systemd service</li>
</ul>
Here is an example of how you can accomplish this:
<p></p>
<pre>adduser deploy
echo "deploy:jenkins" | chpasswd
groupadd train-schedule
usermod -a -G train-schedule deploy
echo "deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl stop train-schedule" &gt;&gt; /etc/sudoers
echo "deploy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemctl start train-schedule" &gt;&gt; /etc/sudoers
echo -e "[Unit]\\nDescription=Train Schedule\\nAfter=network.target\\n\\n[Service]\\n\\nType=simple\\nWorkingDirectory=/opt/train-schedule\\nExecStart=/usr/bin/node bin/www\\nStandardOutput=syslog\\nStandardError=syslog\\nRestart=on-failure\\n\\n[Install]\\nWantedBy=multi-user.target" &gt; /etc/systemd/system/train-schedule.service
/usr/bin/systemctl daemon-reload
mkdir -p /opt/train-schedule
chown root:train-schedule /opt/train-schedule
chmod 775 /opt/train-schedule/
yum -y install nodejs unzip
