                                <p></p><p>In order to implement canary testing in Kubernetes, you need to have a basic idea of how to orchestrate canary pods alongside normal pods within Kubernetes itself. This video will show you how to implement this by demonstrating how to set up a canary deployment manually. This will prepare for the next lesson, which will show how this process can be automated as part of a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins.</p>
<p>You can find the sample source code that was used in this demo here: <a href="https://github.com/linuxacademy/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-canary">https://github.com/linuxacademy/cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-canary</a></p>
<br>
<p>Be sure to check out the <strong>example-solution</strong> branch to find the canary deployment template in train-schedule-kube-canary.yml.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are the commands used to deploy the stable and canary pods in the demo:</p>
<pre>cd ~/
git clone <your fork="">
cd cicd-pipeline-train-schedule-canary/
kubectl apply -f train-schedule-kube.yml
vi train-schedule-kube-canary.yml
kubectl apply -f train-schedule-kube-canary.yml
</your></pre>
<p></p>
