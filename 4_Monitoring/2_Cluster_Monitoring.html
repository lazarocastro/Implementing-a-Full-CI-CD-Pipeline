Fortunately, there is a ready-made community dashboard that can be easily imported into your grafana installation to quickly get some insight into the performance and stability of your cluster. In this lesson, you will learn how to import the Kubernetes All Nodes community dashboard in order to set up cluster monitoring for your Kubernetes cluster.</p>
